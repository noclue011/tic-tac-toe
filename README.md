## General Information
The purpose of this project was to serve as training for me to further learn React. The project is a basic tic-tac-toe game that allows 2 players to play through a game in their browser. To complete this project I followed a tutorial on how to create the basic game, and the tutorial finished with a series of extra challenges that I could complete on my own to test my skills with React.


## Technologies Used
* Javascript 1.5
* React 17.0.2
* CSS
* HTML


## Features
* Automatically tracks whose turn it is.
* Declares a winner or a draw for the game when appropriate.
* Keeps track of previously played moves and allows the player to click a button to go back to the previous move.
* Highlights the last played move
* A toggle switch allows players to change the order that previous moves are shown in (asc. or desc.)
* Highlights the squares that caused a win when a player wins
